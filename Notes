Batch 1
=======

- We should add a ReleaseID propertiy to one of the windows resources
- Need to add the ability in only_if to update the impact
- Most of the unclassified controls could be implemented in one control that uses an input 
  which is a hash perhaps?
- V-74725 - The NA case is not accounted for - and its somewhat insane need to talk to DISA
- v-74415 - does this mean it is na for 1507 and 1607 like the control after it ? etc?

Batch 2
- 70639 is complicated - given the two control NA link we need to figure out how to best implement the test
- 63927 - Did we take care of the case in L41? The if Auditors group and user case?
- We need to add `domains`, `domain_name` and `is_domain?(param)`,`domain_sid` etc functions to the windows resources
- Review 63875 and 63871 to account for the Standalone and Domain issue - see Powershell reference
- we should add a function to `inspec check` that scans the desc, check and fix text for "NA" and then minimally just insures we have `impact 0.0` in the file.
- v-74415 - does this mean it is na for 1507 and 1607 like the control after it ? etc?
