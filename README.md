# microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline

InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of Microsoft Windows 10, against DISA's Microsoft Windows 10 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) Version 1, Release 19.

## Getting Started

It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a "runner" host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over winrm.

For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.

Latest versions and installation options are available at the InSpec site.
